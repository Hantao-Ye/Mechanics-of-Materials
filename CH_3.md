# CH_3

## Hooke's Law

$$
\sigma=E\varepsilon
$$

- _E_: the modulus of elasticity of Youngs' modulus, which has the stress units

## Poison Ratio

$$
\nu=-\frac{\varepsilon'}{\varepsilon}
$$

- $\nu$: Poison Ratio
- $\varepsilon$: axial strain
- $\varepsilon'$: lateral strain

## Shear Stress

the stress component that act in the plane of the sectioned area

### Average Bearing Stress

$$
\sigma_b=\frac{F_b}{A_b}
$$

- $F_b$: bearing force
- $A_b$: bearing area

Average Shear Stress at Section

$$
\tau_{aver}=\frac{V}{A}
$$

- $V$: internal shear force at section determined from equations of equilibrium
- $A$: area of section

#### Single Shear

$$
V=F
$$

</div>

#### Double Shear

$$
V=\frac{F}{2}
$$

</div>

- Positive strain is when the angle between two positive faces is reduced
- Negative strain is when the angle between two positive faces is increased

### Hooke's Law for Shear

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \tau&=G\gamma\\[2ex]
     G&=\frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $G$: shear modulus of elasticity

## Allowable Stresses and Allowance Loads

When designing a structural member or mechanical element, the design interest is **strength**, that is _the capacity of the object to support or transmit loads_

- factor of safety (F.S.)

$$
n=\frac{Actual\;Strength}{Required\;Strength}
$$

- allowable strength

## Design for Axial Loads and Direct Shear

- determine the area of section subjected to a normal force

$$
A=\frac{P}{\sigma_{allow}}
$$

- determine the area of section subjected to a shear force

$$
A=\frac{V}{\tau_{allow}}
$$
