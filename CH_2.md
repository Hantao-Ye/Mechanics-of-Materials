## Elastic behavior

- A straight line
- Stress is proportional to strain
- Upper stress limit <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5C%3B%5Csigma_%7Bpl%7D">
- If load is removed upon reaching the limit, specimen will return to its original shape

## Yielding

- Material deforms permanently (plastic deformation)
- Yield strength <img src ="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5C%3B%5Csigma_%7BY%7D">
- Once the load is removed, specimen continues to elongate without any increase in load
- Materials referred to as being perfectly plastic
- The _torsional force_ cause **the slip line**

## Strain hardening

- Ultimate stress <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5C%3B%5Csigma_%7Bu%7D">
- While specimen is elongated, its x-sectional area will decrease
- Decrease in area is fairly uniform over entire gauge length

## Necking

- At ultimate stress, x-sectional area begins to decrease in a localized region
- Specimen finally breaks at fracture stress <img src = "https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5C%3B%5Csigma_%7Bf%7D">
